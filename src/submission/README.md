For training submission models and creating upload pickle files, make sure to use an environment that agrees with `numerai_requirements.txt` (previously found at https://github.com/numerai/numerai-predict/tree/master... see also https://docs.numer.ai/numerai-tournament/submissions/model-uploads).

For example, run `pip install -r numerai_requirements.txt`.
